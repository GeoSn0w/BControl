# BControl
Screen Brightness Control via WMI in C# for Windows. Tested and working fine on iMac 2011 21.5 inch. Should work on most modern graphics cards because it's not dependent on the video card driver APIs, and it rather uses the WMI queries.

* This requires Administrator Privileges to be able to query the video card data.
* Also provides information about the video card model, processor type, and driver version.

I made it because my iMac running Windows 8.1 lacks the brightness control with the Bootcamp drivers I have, so I figured I should make myself a tool since I knew the graphics card it uses does support the feature.
